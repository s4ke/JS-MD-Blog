Welcome to my blog!
===================

<br>

Why is there only one html file (index.html)?
----------------------------------------

<br>

This blog is - even though it is kind of dynamic - completely run inside your browser :).
This works by parsing the URL and reloading the content you want by AJAX. This content
is markdown that is then parsed and written into the HTML document. :)

Some of the stuff I am working on:
<a href="index.html?site=work.md">Click me</a>
